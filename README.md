##  Key Steps

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Removed duplicate values.
* Standardized the **DiscountOffer** column into a uniform format.
* Filled missing **DiscountPrice** values with the category-wise average.
* Replaced null values in **SizeOption** with `"Not Available"`.

### 2. **Data Analysis**

* Calculated the **average original price** for products with ratings above 4.
* Counted the number of products with **discounts greater than 50%**.
* Counted the number of products available in **Size M**.
* Created a new column to label offers as:

  * **High Discount** → more than 50%
  * **Low Discount** → 50% or below

### 3. **Data Retrieval & Lookup**

* Used **VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP** to fetch brand, price, and rating for a given product ID.
* Applied **INDEX & MATCH** to find the discount price of specific products.
